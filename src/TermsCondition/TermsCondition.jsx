            <h3>TOUR DESTINATION</h3>
            <p>
              tour On chooses where you go based on your budget, preferences,
              and travel dates. Have an open mind, get ready to explore, and

              By agreeing to these Terms & Conditions, you give tourOn
              permission to decide the itinerary for your trip. As such, TourOn
              cannot be held liable if you are unhappy with your destination,
              and we will not offer refunds under these circumstances. We plan
              for your destination city based upon your survey request, budget,

            <p>
              If there are any specific cities you do not wish to visit on your
              trip with TourOn, please let us know and we will avoid it for your
              vacation.
            </p>
            <h5>TRAVEL DETAILS</h5>
            <h5>Name Changes</h5>
            <p>
              Please, please make sure your name matches your ID exactly! The
              name change charge is completely based on the service provider fee
              and we are not liable for providing incorrect name.
              <br />
              All passenger details must exactly match your government issued ID
              (Aadhaar, Pan Card, Passport, Voter ID, or Driver’s License). Your
              booking will be made under this name and changes to name details
              are not allowed by many airlines and other service providers.
              While we will do our best to make such a change if necessary,
              please bear in mind that most airlines and other service providers
              treat a name change as a cancellation, to which standard
              conditions and charges apply. If you are planning on changing your
              name, please contact TourOn as soon as possible.
            </p>
            <h5>Ticket Changes</h5>
            <p>
              Need to change your travel dates/times? We’ll do our best, but we
              can’t make any promises. Give us a call as soon as possible if
              something comes up.
              <br />
              Changes are subject to availability. If you have a change in
              plans, if you can no longer depart at the intended time as
              originally stated, or if you plan not to take a flight, bus, or
              train as booked, please contact TourOn as soon as possible to
              discuss your options, and we cannot guarantee a refund or
              rebooking. Trips can be booked up to two week prior to departure
              and destination depends on the latest budget and given timeline
              for planning.
            </p>
            <h5>Day of Travel</h5>
            <p>
              We’ll tell you exactly when and where you need to be to catch your
              flight, bus, or train. PLEASE don’t be late. If you have any
              questions about your reservation, give us a call!
              <br />
              We’ll give you as much information as possible for your hassle
              free travel. Failure to check-in for your flight, bus, or train at
              the appropriate time may result in the airline denying you
              boarding and TourOn may not grant a refund. Check-in times vary by
              carrier/airport, and one week prior to departure, TourOn will
              advise the best time to arrive and check in for your travel,
              according to your departure time and mode of transportation.
              Should you have any questions regarding this timing or process,
              contact TourOn as soon as possible.
            </p>
            <h5>Missed Travel</h5>
            <p>
              If you miss your travel, there’s not much we can do. We’ll give
              you all the information you need to get there with plenty of time,
              and it’s up to you to get there.
              <br />
              If you fail to check in on time for a confirmed reservation, the
              airline, bus, or train carrier may register you as a “no-show,”
              which could result in extra charges and/or your whole travel
              itinerary being cancelled and/or render your ticket void. TourOn
              is not responsible for missed travel as a result of customer
              error.
            </p>
            <h5>Cancelled Travel</h5>
            <p>
              If you need to cancel your trip, call us ASAP! We can’t promise
              you’ll get your money back, because that depends on the
              transportation + accommodation companies, but we’ll do our best
              for you.
              <br />
              Cancelled bookings will not be fully refunded. Refunds are subject
              to the transportation and accommodation providers through which
              your reservations are made. You may forfeit 100% of the cost of
              the booking. If your plans change for any reason, please contact
              TourOn at your earliest convenience. Any cancellations made the
              week of travel will not be refunded.
            </p>
            <h5>Ticket Delivery</h5>
            <p>
              Double check your email address! This is how we’re sending you
              your tickets and all important information the day before you
              leave. You’ll be receiving an envelope in the mail before you
              leave, so double check your mailing address, too.
              <br />
              The vast majority of our travel partners offer e-tickets. You will
              receive your e-ticket one day before departure by email. Some
              travel partners may require you to print your ticket at the
              airport. Where this is the case, TourOn will provide all necessary
              documents and details the day of departure by email. If you do not
              receive these documents, please contact TourOn as soon as
              possible. Please be sure to double check your email address when
              checking out!{' '}
            </p>
            <h5>Luggage Restrictions</h5>
            <p>
              We’ll let you know exactly how to pack - what checked bags you’re
              allowed, etc. If you’re a heavy packer, any extra fees are your
              responsibility. Most of the domestic airline will provide 15kg
              luggage allowance and 7kg cabin luggage option.
              <br />
              TourOn sells products and services as an agent on behalf of
              airline, bus, and train carriers (Third Party Suppliers).
              Depending on your mode of transportation and transportation
              company, we’ll tell you exactly what you are getting one week
              prior to departure (one checked bag, only carry-on baggage, etc.)
              TourOn has no responsibility for products or services provided by
              any Third Party Suppliers that you purchase separately (extra
              checked bags, food or drinks on flight, etc.). We give and make no
              warranty or representation regarding the services or products
              supplied by Third Party Suppliers. Luggage and Baggage policies
              vary from carrier to carrier. One week prior to departure, you
              will be alerted by TourOn of any size and weight restrictions to
              which you must adhere. Should your baggage not comply with these
              restrictions, you will incur all additional charges.
            </p>
            <h5>Air Transportation Safety Compliance</h5>
            <p>
              Don’t bring any weapons on the plane. Please.
              <br />
              Important airline ticket terms and conditions and other important
              notices apply to air transportation. Indian law forbids the
              carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in your luggage or
              on your person. A violation can result in imprisonment and
              penalties as per Indian Penal Code. Hazardous materials include
              explosives, compressed gases, flammable liquids and solids,
              oxidizers, poisons, corrosives and radioactive materials.
              Examples: Paints, lighter fluid, fireworks, tear gases, oxygen
              bottles, and radiopharmaceuticals. There are special exceptions
              for small quantities (up to 70 ounces total) of medicinal and
              toilet articles carried in your luggage and certain smoking
              materials carried on your person. For further information contact
              your airline representative. Violation of these restrictions will
              result in imprisonment and financial penalties. TourOn will not be
              held liable for transgressions against air transportation
              requirements. Please refer to airlines guidelines for further
              details on prohibited items.
            </p>
            <h5>Accommodation Compliance</h5>
            <p>
              Follow the rules! Don’t smoke, don’t break anything. If you get
              charged for anything by non compliance as per hotel policy we
              can’t help you there.
              <br />
              Note that your payment through TourOn covers your reservation
              fees. All additional fees incurred through incidentals (room
              service, late checkout, etc.) are to be paid by the customer. You
              may be asked to provide a credit or debit card at the time of
              check in. The hotel, bed & breakfast, or other accommodation may
              reserve the right to charge your credit or debit card for any
              damage incurred to your room or the accommodation during your
              stay, or for any items that are missing upon departure.
              Incidentals and rates will vary by accommodation booking.
              <br />
              Customers are required to comply with all rules and regulations of
              the booked accommodation. Failure to do so may result in fees or
              expulsion from the hotel or bed & breakfast. TourOn will not be
              held liable for any additional fees incurred, or legal proceedings
              between the customer and accommodation.{' '}
            </p>
            <h5>Important Note – Conditions Beyond Our Control</h5>
            <p>
              There are some things that even we can’t control (natural
              disasters, food poisoning, etc.) If something goes seriously
              wrong, we can’t promise any full refunds. As always, just give us
              a call and we’ll see what we can do. If there is an extreme
              weather situation, we’ll help you get sorted out and make sure you
              have a plan to get back home, but will not cover the additional
              expenses. You should be careful while performing any adventurous
              activities and TourOn will not be responsible if anything goes
              wrong.
              <br />
              Compensation will not apply if a significant change is made for
              reasons beyond our control. These include: war, riots, civil
              disturbances, terrorist activity, industrial disputes, natural and
              nuclear disasters, fire, epidemics, health risks, changes due to
              rescheduling or cancellation of flights by an airline or
              alteration of the airline or aircraft type; closed or congested
              airports or ports; flood and other actual or potential severe
              weather conditions, act of government or public authorities or
              other circumstances.
              <br />
              TourOn cannot accept liability or responsibility for any airline
              or supplier bankruptcy or insolvency and the failure to provide
              any services that may follow
            </p>
            <h5>Liability Statement</h5>
            <p>
              We’ve done our absolute best to make sure your accommodation and
              travel arrangements are top-notch. If you think they’re sub-par,
              let us know. Unfortunately, there are some things that are simply
              out of our control.
              <br />
              TourOn acts as an agent for independent travel suppliers, such as
              airlines, hotels and other independent suppliers to provide you
              with the services you purchase; and is represented in destination
              by companies organized and existing in that destination, including
              providers of transportation and excursions. We have taken all
              reasonable steps to ensure that proper arrangements have been made
              for your vacation. However, we do not accept and expressly
              disclaim any liability for the actions or omissions of these
              independent suppliers. If you find you have any dispute with such
